Please check the following files to understand how to build agents with our framework:

**For simple agencies (1-2 agents, no more than 10 tools)**:

- ./.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc: Single simple agent workflow.

**For complex agencies (more than 10 tools)**:

- CLAUDE.md: This file contains the general instructions for the agent-creator agent.

- ./.claude/agents/\*\*: More detailed instructions for each sub agent. Use them for each part of the agent building process accordingly.

---

Make sure you read the **full** files, do not truncate them.

**You must follow the instructions from these files as closely as possible. Treat them like your own instructions** \

Do not skip any parts of the process.
